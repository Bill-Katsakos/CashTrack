# CashTrack

## Overview
CashTrack is an MVP MERN stack web application that allows users to track their expenses efficiently. Users can register and log in to manage their personal expense records.

### Features
The application consists of three main pages:

- **Add New Expense**
  - Users can add expenses from the current day and previous dates.
  - Each expense entry includes a description, a pre-filled date (defaulting to today for convenience), and the amount.

- **Today's Expenses**
  - Displays all expenses recorded for the current day.
  - Users can edit or delete any expense.
  - The total amount spent today is displayed in the title.

- **History**
  - Lists all expenses sorted chronologically and grouped by month.
  - Users can edit or delete any past expenses.
  - Each month displays the total amount spent.

Additionally, a **currency selection** feature is available in the navigation bar. Currently, this setting is not stored in the database and is for demonstration purposes only.
